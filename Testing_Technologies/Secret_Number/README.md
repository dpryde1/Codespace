# Secret Number Game

This project is a game where the user (player) tries to guess a number between 1 and 10 that the computer is thinking of.

## How it is used

It is used by launching the HTML file in a browser and using the mouse to choose boxes populated with numbers.

The player gets 3 guesses to find the number that the computer is thinking of. Every guess will reveal if the guess was too high, too low, or is correct.

Either the player guesses correctly within the 3 guesses, or the game ends, disables the buttons, and then reveals the answer.

## Assumptions

The project brief was deliberately vague, so I was left to make my own assumptions:

I assumed that a range of 1 to 10 was appropriate so that it was easily achievable within 3 guesses without overwhelming the player.

I assumed that clicking on boxes was a more easily understandable input method (as opposed to typing within a text box) as the entire range is clearly visible to the player.

I assumed that a simple presentation was best, as to not make it appear "too busy" visually for the player.

I assumed that the player could be of any age or technical ability, so I made it as simple as possible.

## Possible future changes

While it is a simple game, there are a couple changes that could benefit it in the future:

Making the incorrect choice boxes permanently change colour (for the remainder of that round), so that they are more easily tracked.

Making the boxes change colour upon hovering with the cursor, to make it more abvious what the choice will be (mainly thinking of elderly and young children here).

Making the browser automatically refresh the page a few seconds after the game ends. This will enable it to be left on display and played all day (for example, at a public attraction/science centre etc) unattended, by players who might not even know how to refresh a browser page.

Perhaps adding some simple animations for different actions would make it more visually engaging.
